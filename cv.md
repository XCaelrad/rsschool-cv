## ABOUT ME

I am an aspiring Frontend developer. My journey in it started with learning UX/UI design, but during college days in a computer science class the teacher introduced us to website design. Not design, but layout. I remember back then we wrote everything in Notepad++. I was fascinated by it, but I continued to study design, even went to university. But at some point I got a course from Stepik "Basics of HTML and CSS" and then my study of Frontend development began. Now I am starting a new course from RS SCHOOL "JavaScript/Front-end".
